import random

# Select random number between 0 and 10, say magic_number

# Keep asking user input as number until the input is equal to the magic_number
# Provide user hint if the value is too high or low
  #If user input < magic_number then print 'Too low', if user input > magic_number the print 'Too high'
    
# Finally print("You win !!!")
